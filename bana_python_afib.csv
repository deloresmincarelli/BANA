Procedure: 2D Echo with Doppler and color flow (93306). The exam was of adequate technical quality. Left Ventricle: Overall left ventricular ejection fraction is estimated to be 50-55%. The left ventricle is normal in size. There is normal left ventricular wall thickness. Septal motion is consistent with conduction abnormality. No left ventricular thrombus detected. Right Ventricle: The right ventricle is normal size. There is normal right ventricular wall thickness. The right ventricular systolic function is normal. Left Atrium: The left atrial size is normal. Right Atrium: Right atrial size is normal. Mitral Valve: The mitral valve leaflets appear normal. There is mild mitral regurgitation. There is no evidence of mitral valve prolapse. The mitral valve area by the pressure half-time method is 3.8 cm^2. There is no mitral valve stenosis. Aortic Valve: The Aortic Valve is mildly calcified. No aortic regurgitation is present. Aortic valve peak gradient is 8.1 mmHg. Aortic valve area is 2.0 cm^2. Aortic valve mean gradient is 4.0 mmHg. No hemodynamically significant valvular aortic stenosis. Aortic Root: The aortic root is normal size. Tricuspid Valve: The tricuspid valve is normal in structure and function. Trace tricuspid regurgitation is present. The right ventricular systolic pressure is 19.6 mmHg. Right ventricular systolic pressure is normal at <35 mmHg. Diastolic Function: Normal Diastolic Function. Pulmonic Valve/Pulmonary Artery: The pulmonic valve is normal in structure. There is trace pulmonic valvular regurgitation. Pericardium: There is no pericardial effusion. There is no pleural effusion. ECG/Heart Rate: Normal sinus rhythm, with a rate of 84 beats per minute. _______________________________________________________________________________ ",0
